# To Do List

I'm currently getting started with studying web development. In order to try and grasp the basic concepts of HTML, CSS and JS I am trying to follow a hands-on approach by working on smaller projects. 
This To-Do list was a first fun project to work on. It contains a few functionalities:
  [x] It can add a new To-Do item
  [x] Mark task as completed
  [x] Delete item
  [x] Organize items properly in a vertical list with spacing between them
  [ ] Filter for 'All', 'Completed' and 'Uncompleted' tasks
